#### SMART ROADS #### 

Mankind is currently facing a tremendous energy demand, bound to increase even more in the years to come. Answering it with sustainable solutions is one of the major challenges of the ecological transition

Our team aims at tackling this issue by working on energy recovering roads : equipping strategic parts of city roads and highways with devices such as piezoelectric transducers, in order to recover some amount of the kinetic energy of circulating vehicles and converting it into electricity. 

This idea is not new, and is currently being tested (e.g in California and Holland) but has not been officially implemented anywhere in the world yet. Thus, we focus on transforming this theoretical idea into a tangible and applicable public policy.

The corresponding deliverable will take the form of a fictional news channel short video documentary about energy recovering roads, set as if our policy project was currently reviewed by governmental agencies and pending for approval.
